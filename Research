Large Language Models
A large language model (LLM) is a deep learning algorithm that can perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Large language models use transformer models and are trained using massive datasets â€” hence, large. This enables them to recognize, translate, predict, or generate text or other content.
